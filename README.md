## Overview
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting plain text documents. 

Markdown is often used for creating documentation, README files, and forum posts. Its syntax is intentionally simple and minimalistic, using plain text characters to indicate formatting elements. 
Markdown allows users to add formatting such as headers, lists, emphasis (italic and bold text), links, images, and code blocks using a straightforward and human-readable syntax.

This guide aims to establish a standardized approach to writing Markdown documentation for our projects. 
By following these guidelines, we ensure consistency, clarity, and improved readability across our documentation.
