A standardized Markdown (`.md`) style guide can help maintain consistency and clarity in your documentation. 
Here's a template you can use as a starting point:

# Markdown Style Guide

## 1. Headers

Use `#` to create headers. Follow the hierarchy for nested headers:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
```

## 2. Emphasis

Use `*` or `_` for emphasis:

```markdown
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__
```

## 3. Lists

Use `*`, `-`, or `1.` for unordered and ordered lists:

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2

- Item 1
- Item 2

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
```

## 4. Links

Use `[text](url)` for inline links:

```markdown
[Google](https://www.google.com)
```

## 5. Images

Use `![alt text](image-url)` for images:

```markdown
![Logo](https://example.com/logo.png)
```

## 6. Code

Use backticks for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks:

Inline code: \`code\`

Code block:

\```python
def example():
    print("Hello, World!")
\```

## 7. Quotes

Use `>` for block quotes:

```markdown
> This is a block quote.
```

## 8. Horizontal Rule

Use three hyphens `---` or three underscores `___` for a horizontal rule:

```markdown
---
```

## 9. Tables

Use pipes `|` to create tables:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
```

## 10. Escaping Characters

Use a backslash `\` to escape special characters:

```markdown
\*escaped\*
```

## 11. Line Breaks

End a line with two spaces for a line break:

```markdown
This is a line  
break.
```

## 12. Checkboxes

Use `- [ ]` for an unchecked checkbox and `- [x]` for a checked one:

```markdown
- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
```

## 13. Headers and Sections

Separate sections with a line break and use headers for clarity:

```markdown
# Section 1

Content of section 1.

# Section 2

Content of section 2.
```

## 14. Consistency

Maintain consistency in formatting and naming conventions throughout the documentation.

## 15. Line Length

Keep lines reasonably short for better readability.

## 16. Folder Structure

Organize files and images in a structured manner, and use relative links.
